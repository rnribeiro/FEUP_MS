# Simulating and Evaluating Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for Comfortable Autonomous Vehicle Manoeuvring in Highway-Env Framework

## Instructions on how to build
- To configure scenarios' parameters go to [args.json](args.json) 
- In order to run train/test, run [pipeline.ipynb](pipeline.ipynb)
- Use boolean "train" to switch between the two states
- Trained models are inside the trained_models folder
